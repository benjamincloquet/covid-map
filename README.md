# covid-map

This is a short project destined to display basic COVID-19 stats on a user friendly world map interface.
I decided to do this project to showcase and test out a few features :
- Usage of Gramvizi's COVID-19 data API
- Planning and implementation of a simple React single page website
- Usage of Leaflet and React Leaflet to display an interactive map
